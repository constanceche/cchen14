- We can create and populate databases using SQLite commands
    - If a database already exists, db = sqlite3.connect("school") 
      will open pre-existing database and add on to it
- Typing commands into the SQLite Shell will have the effect as using c.execute(command)
    - In order to remove testing done in the shell, we deleted the database
      all together to obtain a new blank canvas and a fresh start
- Including a semicolon at the end of SQLite Commands are exteremely important 
  as the command will not run without it  
    - This applies to when using both c.execute(command) or the shell
- It is also important to specify the data type of the value and use quotation 
  marks around strings when inserting data or else the program will have trouble
  running and processing the data.
- We had some trouble with quototation marks and using F-strings
    - After a lot of experimenting, we opted to use .format instead
- Using INTEGER PRIMARY KEY will automatically order the values based on
  the integer value 
    - We chose to use Integer Primary Keys because it differentiated each 
      student in an organized manner
    - In our case, the values in the 'students' table were ordered based on 
      their ID number
    - Because the ID number was set as the Integer Primary Key previously in 
      the 'students' table, the 'courses' table is also ordered by the ID number
- Attempting to open SQLite files will result in unreadable text
