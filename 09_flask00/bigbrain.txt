0: Where have you seen similar syntax in other langs?
We've seen this in Java where Flask would be a function and we would input a parameter where __name__ is.

Q1: What points of reference do you have for meaning of '/'?
We've seen '/' in paths to different files.

Q2: Where will this print to?
This will print to an address in a server.

Q3: What will it print?
It will print "__main__".

Q3: Will this appear anywhere? How u know?
No because the function hello_world() is not ran.

After running app.py, "No hablo queso!" appears on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ which we did not expect.

Q4: Where have you seen similar constructs in other languages?
We've seen this in Java where app is the class name and run is the method being called.
