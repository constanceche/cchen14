K28: Bubble Bubble Toil Trouble
2021-05-11

DEMO ONE:
- predictions: clicking on each word will produce a popup of the word
- observation: our prediction was true
- reads the td tag and creates an alert accordingly

DEMO TWO:
- prediction: popups will still occur but there are more "layers" to each item (item, row, table
    - because the table popup is written last, it may override the other functions and appear first
- observation: the popups appeared in the order: item, row, table

DEMO THREE:
- prediction: stopPropagation() determines the order of the popups
    - passing down form parent to child
    - including the line will break the flow of the popups
    - only on epopup will occur (td? table?)
- observation before uncommenting: popup appeared in order (table, cell, row)
- observation after uncommenting: table popup appears, none after
    - adding "true" to even listener made table first priority
    - event.stopPropagation() prevented further popups from occuring

DEMO FOUR:
- prediction: the "trues" in the event listeners cancel each other since they are attached to each one 
    - the original order should stay the same (td, tr, table)
    - event.stopPropagation() prevented further popups from occuring after td
- observation before uncommenting: popups appear in the order: table, row, item
    - capturing instead of bubbling
- observation after uncommenting: event.stopPropagation() prevented further popups from occuring after table


- default is bubbling (useCapture in event listener is default to false)
    - bubbling = child to parent to ancestor (going up tree)
- if true is enable, capturing will take place
    - capturing = ancestor to parent to child (going down tree)
